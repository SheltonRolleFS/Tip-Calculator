# Tip Calculator
This tip calculator was built following a challenge using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I chose to built this calculator using ReactJS to give myself more practice with the framework. For styling I chose to use SASS simply because it is my prefered way of styling websites. SASS' features such as nesting and importing make not only my file structure more organized, but my code looks much cleaner and can flow identically to how the HTML elements flow.
